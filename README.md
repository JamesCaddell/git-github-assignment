# git-github-assignment
This is my lab work for ISE-475

One thing I learned was how simple the pipline is for documents to be passed from a personal directory and github. I think this would have been alot of help during my farmbot project cause instead of emailing files back and forth from my mac to the pi I could have used github. The branching would have helped me to there. This is a super coool skill to have now in terms of deploying and editing code on seperate devices.
One challenge was that my terminal kept asking for a ssh key instead of a passcode but, I think it was because I incorrectly added the notes.txt file.
